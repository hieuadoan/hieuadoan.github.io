I am an Assistant Scientist in the Materials Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory. A chemical engineer by training and a generalist by choice, I am most passionate about using my knowledge and skills to solve various engineering and scientfic problems. My current research interest is in developing intelligent, autonomous workflows such as AI-guided molecular simulations and self-driving robotic experiments to accelerate materials discovery.
