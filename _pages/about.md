My name is Hieu Anh Doan and I am a postdoctoral appointee in the Materials Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory. A chemical engineer by training and a generalist by choice, I am most passionate about using my skills to solve various engineering and scientfic problems. My current research interest is in developing intelligent, autonomous workflows such as AI-guided molecular simulations and self-driving robotic experiments to accelerate materials discovery.
