[Original recipe](https://chefjeanpierre.com/recipes/dessert/creme-caramel/)
## Ingredients: 4 servings, each in an 8z soup cup or ramekin
### The caramel
- Sugar: 1/2 cup
- Water: 1/2 cup

### The custard
- Eggs: 4
- Sweet: 
    + 1/2 cup of sugar OR
    + 1/4 cup of sugar AND 2 oz of white chocolate
- Whole milk: 12 oz
- Heavy Whipping Cream: 12 oz
- Salt: 1 pinch
- Vanilla: 1 table spoon

## Instructions
It is convenient to work on the caramel first, so that we have timet to let it cool down (around 30 minutes)
### The caramel
1. Prepare the cups by adding a tiny bit of nonstick cooking spray. Spread it evenly around the inside.
2. Mix sugar and water well together. Use a small whisk to dissolve the sugar. 
3. Put the mixture into a small pot. Ideally the pot should be light in color so that we can observe the color change in the caramel.
4. Use medium heat and keep checking the color.
5. After about 10 minutes, the mixture will turn from clear to light brown and brown. Turn off the heat and let it go to dark brown.
6. Add half a table spoon of water to stop the cooking. Watch out for the violent reaction!
7. Distribute the caramel to the cups. Let it cool down in the fridge for 30 minutes.

### The custard and finisher
1. Preheat oven to 275°F / 135°F.
2. Mix milk and heavy whipping cream together in a cooking pot and heat up to hot but NOT boiling.
3. Add salt, sugar (and white chocolate). Stir well to dissolve.
4. Put 4 eggs in a bowl. Add vanilla and whisk it very lightly to break up the egg yolks.
5. Add the warm cream to the egg mixture slowly and stir. Filter the mixture with a strainer to remove the undissolved ingredients and egg whites.
6. Add the final mixture to the cups. Put all the cups inside another container and fill will hot water half way to the height of these cups.
7. Put everything into oven and cook for 1 hour.
8. Take everything out and let the cups cool to room temperature (~ 1-3 hours). Put them into the fridge for at least 8 hours. Enjoy!
